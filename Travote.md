Take you to the picturesque scenery

Nothing is more fascinating than the green hills after the spring rain bath.

The entire hillside is full of green and green.

The mist that didnâ€™t come out was like a light silk.

Wrapped around its waist,

Sunlight puts raindrops on each leaf,

They all turned into colorful pearls.
